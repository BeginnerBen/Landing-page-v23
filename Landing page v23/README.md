********This is a landign page for a copywriters  webpage************

* I had to add jQUery as it was neessacry for my javascript code that was given 
  to me from my mentor i have includeed the file library in jQuery folder
  

* all the html files apart form the index have been included in the 
  html folder 

  * all the javascript files are located in the js folder 

* the javascript file is where most of the fun happens 
	--> Ive created 4 sections and linked strings to them 
	--> Ive also created a footer which i link strings to aswell
	--> The navagation bar up the top has also been created using a linked html string 

* usage 
	--> clicking on the nav  bar takes you to the relevant section on the index page
	--> the relevant button will stay highlighted when on the correponding section 
 

* scroll behavior has been added to smoothen index html page scolling 
* dependencies 
	--> could the mentor please explains what this means in content of the project ???
